# About the project

Maptify app is a basically an activity tracker app which uses our geolocation to actually help us mark our activities on a real time map. For displaying the map in our project, the leaflet API (a JavaScript library) has been used. We can easily mark our daily Running, Cycling and dining routines live on the app and keep a note of it.
